# Click-to-Focus

Clicking a notification activates your terminal window — no more hunting for the right window.

## Configuration

In `~/.claude/claude-notifications-go/config.json`:

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "desktop": {
      "clickToFocus": true,
      "terminalBundleId": ""
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `clickToFocus` | `true` | Enable click-to-focus on macOS and Linux |
| `terminalBundleId` | `""` | macOS only: override auto-detected terminal. Use bundle ID like `com.googlecode.iterm2` |

## macOS

Auto-detects your terminal via `TERM_PROGRAM` / `__CFBundleIdentifier`. Uses `terminal-notifier` (auto-installed via `/claude-notifications-go:init`).

| Terminal | Focus method |
|----------|-------------|
| Ghostty | Exact tab focus via Ghostty AppleScript, with AXDocument retry fallback |
| VS Code / Insiders / Cursor | AXTitle via focus-window subcommand |
| iTerm2 | Exact tab/pane targeting via iTerm2 Python API when available, otherwise app-level iTerm activation |
| Warp, kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, Hyper, Apple Terminal | AXTitle via focus-window subcommand |
| Any other (custom `terminalBundleId`) | AXTitle via focus-window subcommand |

To find your terminal's bundle ID: `osascript -e 'id of app "YourTerminal"'`

### Permissions

All terminals with click-to-focus may require up to two permissions for window-level focus:

- **Accessibility** — to enumerate and raise the correct window via the AX API
- **Screen Recording** — to read window titles across Spaces (macOS 10.15+)

Screen Recording is requested automatically via system prompt on first use.
Accessibility is prompted via a one-time notification with a link to System Settings.

Without these permissions, clicking a notification still activates the terminal app,
but raises whichever window was last active rather than the project-specific one.

## Linux

Uses a background D-Bus daemon. Auto-detects terminal and compositor.

| Terminal | Supported compositors |
|----------|----------------------|
| VS Code | GNOME, KDE, Sway, X11 |
| GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Alacritty, kitty, WezTerm, Tilix, Terminator, XFCE4 Terminal, MATE Terminal | GNOME, KDE, Sway, X11 |
| Any other | Fallback by name |

Focus methods (tried in order):

1. **GNOME**: `activate-window-by-title` extension, Shell Eval, FocusApp (GNOME 45+)
2. **Sway / wlroots**: `wlrctl`
3. **KDE Plasma**: `kdotool`
4. **X11** (XFCE, MATE, Cinnamon, i3, bspwm): `xdotool`

Falls back to standard notifications if no focus tool is available.

### Diagnostics

If Linux click-to-focus focuses the wrong window, run the diagnostic script immediately after reproducing the failed click:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/main/scripts/linux-focus-debug.sh | bash
```

It writes a report file in the current directory with:

- session type and terminal environment variables
- available focus tools (`xdotool`, `wmctrl`, `remotinator`, etc.)
- current window information and window lists
- installed plugin metadata and recent `notification-debug.log` lines

Review the file before sharing it publicly, because it may include local paths and window titles.

## Multiplexers

On both macOS and Linux, click-to-focus supports **tmux**, **zellij**, **WezTerm**, and **kitty** — clicking a notification switches to the correct session/pane/tab.

### iTerm2 + tmux Control Mode (-CC)

When using iTerm2's tmux integration (`tmux -CC`), standard `tmux select-window` doesn't switch iTerm2 tabs. The plugin detects control mode automatically and uses the iTerm2 Python API instead.

**Requirements:**
1. Python 3 installed
2. iTerm2 → Settings → General → Magic → **Enable Python API**
3. iterm2 venv (set up automatically by `bootstrap.sh` / `install.sh`)

**Manual setup** (if automatic setup failed):
```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.claude/claude-notifications-go/iterm2-venv
~/.claude/claude-notifications-go/iterm2-venv/bin/pip install iterm2
```

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Show the plugin root path (run inside Claude Code hook context)
echo "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"

# List all iTerm2 tabs with tmux pane mappings
~/.claude/claude-notifications-go/iterm2-venv/bin/python3 \
  "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/iterm2-select-tab.py" --list
```

If the Python API is not available, the plugin falls back to standard `tmux select-window` (which may not switch iTerm2 tabs in -CC mode). If you just toggled the setting, restart iTerm2 once. For plain iTerm2, the fallback is app-level activation instead of exact tab targeting.

## Windows

Clicking a notification raises the terminal **window** that started the task. Enabled by the same `clickToFocus` flag; no extra configuration.

How it works (no admin rights, no COM server):

1. When the notification fires, the plugin walks up the process tree to the terminal window hosting Claude (Windows Terminal, VS Code, conhost, ConEmu, …) and records its window handle, PID, title and project folder.
2. The toast is shown via [go-toast](https://git.sr.ht/~jackmordaunt/go-toast) with **protocol activation**, carrying that context in a `claude-notify-focus:` URI. A per-user handler for that scheme is registered under `HKCU\Software\Classes` (idempotent; refreshed if the binary moves).
3. Clicking the toast launches the URI, which re-runs the binary's `focus-windows` subcommand. It re-finds the window (by handle, then PID, then title/folder) and raises it with `ShowWindow` + `SetForegroundWindow`.

### Scope: window-level only

Focus is **window-level**. Windows Terminal runs every tab and split pane inside one top-level window, and Win32 can only raise *windows*, not tabs — there is no public API to focus a specific WT tab by session (it's an open feature request on Windows Terminal). Additionally, when several WT windows run under a single `WindowsTerminal.exe` process, the plugin can resolve the terminal process but not which of its windows hosts a given tab. So:

- A single terminal window → raised reliably.
- Multiple **separate** windows → best effort (the foreground / most-recent window is chosen); it may not be the exact one when the session is in a background window.
- **Tabs and split panes** inside a window are not individually targetable.
